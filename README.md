The Student Management System is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users (typically teachers or administrators) to add, view, edit, and delete student records in a structured and user-friendly interface. The purpose of this project is to practice DOM manipulation, form validation, event handling, and data storage using JavaScript.

This project is completely client-side, meaning it does not use any backend or database. Instead, data is temporarily stored using JavaScript arrays or browser localStorage.
